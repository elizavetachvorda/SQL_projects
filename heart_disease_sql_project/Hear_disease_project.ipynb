    "# Exploratory Data Analysis of Heart Disease and Demographic Trends\n",
    "\n",
    "Heart disease stands as a significant contributor to mortality in both men and women. In this data analysis project, I delve into the heart disease dataset to identify common features among distinct demographic groups, aiming to predict and prevent the development of heart disease. The dataset used for this analysis can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset/data).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Objective\n",
    "The primary objective is to define potential factors contributing to the development of heart disease, laying the groundwork for predictive and preventive measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding the Data\n",
    "To kick off the analysis, I conducted an exploration of the dataset, ensuring data cleanliness where necessary. The dataset comprises 14 attributes, each providing valuable insights into the patient's health profile:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Age (age):** Patient’s age in years.\n",
    "- **Gender (sex):** Patient’s gender. (M = Male, F = Female)\n",
    "- **Chest Pain Type (cp):** Chest pain type. (Values: ATA, NAP, ASY, TA)\n",
    "- **Resting Blood Pressure (trestbps):** Resting blood pressure in mm Hg.\n",
    "- **Serum Cholesterol (chol):** Serum cholesterol in mg/dl.\n",
    "- **Fasting Blood Sugar (fbs):** Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl. (0 = True, 1 = False)\n",
    "- **Resting Electroencephalographic Result (restecg):** Resting electroencephalographic result. (Values: Normal, ST, LVH)\n",
    "- **Maximum Heart Rate (thalach):** Maximum heart rate achieved.\n",
    "- **Exercise-Induced Angina (exang):** Exercise-induced angina. (N = No, Y = Yes)\n",
    "- **ST Depression (oldpeak):** ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.\n",
    "- **Slope of the ST Segment (slope):** Slope of the peak exercise ST segment. (Values: Up, Flat, Down)\n",
    "- **Number of Major Vessels (ca):** Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy.\n",
    "- **Thalassemia (thal):** Thalassemia type. (0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversible defect)\n",
    "- **Heart Disease Occurrence (target):** Presence of heart disease. (0 = No, 1 = Yes)\n",
    "\n",
    "This comprehensive exploration sets the stage for a detailed analysis of the dataset, uncovering patterns and relationships within the data.\n"

    "- Gender distribution shows a higher percentage of males (69.56%) compared to females (30.44%).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chest Pain Analysis:\n",
    "- Chest pain types vary among different age groups. Notably, the prevalence of 'TA' chest pain increases with age and it's the most prominent in the group 51-60 years old.\n",
    "- Detailed breakdowns of chest pain types based on age groups and gender provide valuable insights into potential correlations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cardiovascular Risk Factors:\n",
    "- Average resting blood pressure is 131.61 mm Hg, average serum cholesterol is 246.00 mg/dl, and the average maximum heart rate achieved is 149.11.\n",
    "- The majority of the population has fasting blood sugar levels below 120 mg/dl (85.07%).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resting Electrocardiographic Results:\n",
    "- The most common electrocardiographic result is 'Normal' (18.51%), followed by 'ST' elevation (11.89%).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise-Related Insights:\n",
    "- Approximately 33.66% of the population experiences exercise-induced angina.\n",
    "- The average ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest is 1.07.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Heart Disease Severity Indicators:\n",
    "- The distribution of the slope of the peak exercise ST segment shows a significant proportion with a 'Flat' slope (47.02%).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Number of Major Vessels and Thalassemia Types:\n",
    "- The majority of individuals have 0 or 1 major vessels colored by fluoroscopy.\n",
    "- 'Fixed defect' is the most common thalassemia type, followed by 'Reversible defect' and 'Normal.'\n",
    "\n",
    "This comprehensive analysis provides a foundation for further investigation and modeling to predict and prevent heart disease. The insights gained contribute to a better understanding of the dataset and highlight potential areas for focused research and intervention.\n"
