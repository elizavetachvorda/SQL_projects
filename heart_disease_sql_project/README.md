# Exploratory Data Analysis of Heart Disease and Demographic Trends

This project delves into a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a heart disease dataset, aiming to unearth essential demographic trends and identify pivotal risk factors. The analysis is performed utilizing SQL, showcasing a robust set of skills including:

- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs):** Employed CTEs for improved readability and modular structuring of complex SQL queries.
- **Aggregate Functions:** Utilized aggregate functions to extract valuable statistical insights, such as averages, counts, and percentages.
- **Creating Views:** Constructed views to encapsulate specific data perspectives, facilitating streamlined analysis and reporting.
- **Converting Data Types:** Ensured data clarity and consistency by converting data types, enhancing the interpretability of the dataset.
- **CASE Statement:** Applied CASE statements for conditional logic, enabling dynamic transformations of numeric values into descriptive labels.
- **Subqueries:** Integrated subqueries to perform nested analyses, facilitating a more granular exploration of the dataset.

The project not only cleansed the dataset by replacing numeric values with meaningful labels but also provided in-depth analyses of demographic features, cardiovascular risk factors, and severity indicators. The skills applied demonstrate a mastery of SQL techniques for data exploration, setting the stage for informed decision-making and future predictive modeling.

Explore the SQL queries and analyses to gain insights into the dataset, ultimately contributing to a deeper understanding of heart disease and its associated factors.
