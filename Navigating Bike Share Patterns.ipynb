    "# Data Analysis Portfolio Project using SQL and Tableau: Navigating Bike Share Patterns in San Francisco\n",

    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This bike-share analysis case study aims to **practice the skills** gained in the [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.example.com/certificate) and to showcase my **eagerness and ability** to work in this position.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "I am a **junior data analyst** working at SunCycle, a bike-share company in San Francisco. The **Director of Marketing** believes that San Francisco has great potential for a large number of people to switch to bicycles and enjoy the true beauty of the city outdoors. Therefore, our analyst team aims to understand who currently favors bicycles and how we can reach a broader audience. Using these insights, our team will design a new marketing strategy to make the service more comfortable and user-friendly for both citizens and visitors, enabling more people to benefit from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ask\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Design marketing strategies to reach a broader audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Guiding Questions for Analysis:**\n",
    "1. What is the most popular membership type?\n",
    "2. How do annual/monthly members and casual riders utilize SunCycle bikes differently based on season, day of the week, and time of day?\n",
    "3. Are bikes consistently available for daily use? Are there stations that may require additional docking points or new stations in proximity?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prepare\n",
    "\n",
    "The data used in this analysis originates from the San Francisco Ford GoBike Share datasets hosted on **Google BigQuery**. The dataset spans the years 2013 to 2018 and includes trip details such as trip id, start time, end time, trip duration, start station, end station, and latitude/longitude coordinates, capacity for each station. This comprehensive dataset, collected by SunCycle, provides insights into various aspects of cyclist behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "To facilitate analysis, the data was initially organized as separate files and saved in CSV format. In the **BigQuery console**, I queried two specific files, namely 'bikeshare_trips' and 'bikeshare_station_info.' These datasets were then joined, and the consolidated information was downloaded as a CSV file and stored locally on my PC.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Process\n",
    "\n",
    "In the **BigQuery console**, the dataset turned out to be enormous, prompting the need for proper sorting and filtering to facilitate further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Table: bikeshare_trips**\n",
    "1. I selected columns deemed useful for the analysis.\n",
    "2. Changed the data type of the 'duration_sec' column, converting it to minutes and rounding numeric values to 2 decimals.\n",
    "3. Joined two columns, 'subscriber_type' and 'c_subscription_type,' which were occasionally interchanging.\n",
    "4. Since the table lacked data for the entire year, I focused on the accessible and informative period from **July 2017 to April 2018**.\n",
    "5. During examination, I identified lines with NULL values in fields such as 'start_station_name,' 'end_station_name,' 'start_station_id,' and 'end_station_id.' I cleaned the table by eliminating rows where NULLs could pose potential issues.\n",
    "6. Given that the table encompassed data from various regions, I applied filtering using the **IN** function and a subquery.\n"

    "\n",
    "**Strategic Advertising:**\n",
    "- Place advertisements in airports, train stations, buses to the city center, and popular tourist attractions.\n",
    "- Form partnerships with local businesses, such as hotels/hostels or events, for cross-promotion and discounts for bikeshare users.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Digital Presence:**\n",
    "- Advertise in map applications and other navigation tools.\n",
    "- Leverage social media platforms to create engaging content and share user stories.\n",
    "- Run social media campaigns or challenges to encourage user participation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Seasonal and Location-Based Marketing:**\n",
    "- Time the marketing campaign to coincide with warmer months and focus on the most used stations by Customers.\n",
    "- Identify popular stations among Customers using the provided dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Incentive Programs:**\n",
    "- Introduce a points-based plan where users accumulate points based on the distance traveled, offering discounts on the next subscription or other rewards.\n",
    "- Consider offering 30 minutes free for the first journey to attract new clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Infrastructure Improvement:**\n",
    "- Enhance service comfort by installing more docking points at highly used stations or constructing new stations in proximity.\n"
