# Case Study: Navigating Bike Share Patterns

Bike Share Analysis in San Francisco

## Introduction

This project delves into bike-share patterns in San Francisco, leveraging SQL and Tableau to analyze SunCycle's data. The aim is to devise effective marketing strategies for a broader user base.

## Scenario

As a junior data analyst at SunCycle, I explore bike-share usage to identify opportunities for growth and propose a new, appealing marketing strategy.

## Ask

- What's the most popular membership type?
- How do usage patterns differ for annual/monthly members and casual riders based on season, day, and time?
- Are bikes consistently available, and are additional docking points or new stations needed?

## Data Sources and Preparation

Dataset: San Francisco Ford GoBike Share on Google BigQuery.
Tables: 'bikeshare_trips' and 'bikeshare_station_info.'
Cleaned, organized, and joined for analysis.

## Analysis Highlights

### Membership Type Analysis
Two types: Customers (24/3-day) and Subscribers (annual/30-day).
Majority of rides by Subscribers, indicating higher profitability.

### Usage Patterns Analysis
Subscribers commute on workdays; Customers prefer weekends.
Monthly peaks for Subscribers (Augâ€“Oct) and Customers (warmer months).

### Station Capacity Analysis
Comparison of station popularity and capacities.
Identified busiest stations with potential capacity issues.

### Recommendations

Target Customer membership to expand the user base.
Strategic advertising, digital presence, and seasonal marketing could attract more users.
Incentive programs and infrastructure improvements enhance service appeal.
