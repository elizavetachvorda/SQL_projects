# Data Analysis Portfolio Project using SQL and Tableau: NYC Tree Census and Income project

## Overview

This project aims to analyze the relationship between trees and income in New York City (NYC). The analysis involves exploring datasets containing information about trees and income across various boroughs of NYC. The project utilizes SQL for data manipulation and aggregation and visualizes the findings using Tableau.

## Skills Applied

- SQL: Used for querying and aggregating data from the 'trees' and 'income_trees' tables to perform various analyses such as counting trees, calculating average income, and identifying the top zip codes with the highest and lowest median income.

- Data Visualization with Tableau: Visualized the analyzed data to create informative and interactive dashboards and charts for better understanding and presentation of insights.

## Data Analysis Steps

1. **Data Exploration:**
   - Analyzed the 'trees' dataset to determine the total number of trees and the distribution of trees across different boroughs.
   - Explored the 'income_trees' dataset to understand the income distribution across different zip codes and boroughs.

2. **Data Integration:**
   - Merged the 'trees' and 'income_trees' datasets using SQL to create a unified dataset for further analysis.

3. **Statistical Analysis:**
   - Calculated median and average income for each borough to understand the income distribution.
   - Identified the top and bottom zip codes with the highest and lowest median income in each borough.

4. **Tree Health Analysis:**
   - Investigated the distribution of tree health across different boroughs and identified any disparities based on income levels.

5. **Trunk Diameter Analysis:**
   - Analyzed the average trunk diameter of trees in each borough to infer the age and size of trees.

6. **Visualization:**
   - Utilized Tableau to create visualizations such as bar charts, maps, and dashboards to present the findings in a clear and visually appealing manner.

## Conclusion

Through this project, we gained insights into the distribution of trees and income across NYC boroughs and explored potential relationships between them. The analysis revealed patterns in tree distribution, income levels, and tree health, providing valuable information for urban planning and environmental conservation efforts in NYC.
